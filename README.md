## What is the Stalk Market?

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%284%29.png)

The Stalk Market is an in-game system that involves purchasing turnips on _Sundays from Daisy Mae between 5AM - 12PM_ and selling them to the Nook brothers for a higher price before the next Sunday. Failure to do so will result in the [turnips rotting](https://app.gitbook.com/@aclostboy/s/stalkmarket-faq/~/drafts/-M3q79hFZVQ876BoKdGY/turnips/expiring-and-rot). 

Throughout the week, players will have the opportunity to sell their turnips to _Nook's Cranny_. The price they will offer will change twice a day at noon throughout the week for a total of 14 different price points. Both the buying and selling price will be different for everyone. 

Because you are able to buy and sell on other player's islands, the Stalk Market becomes a game of finding the lowest buying price and highest selling price within the 7-day time limit to make a large profit.

### This is risky business!

Although we will do our best to try and equip you with all the knowledge we can, please understand that it is your responsibility as the player to make a profit. It is **very possible to lose money.**

## How much can I make?

Profits will depend on how much time & resources \(bells\) you are willing to dedicate as a player.
