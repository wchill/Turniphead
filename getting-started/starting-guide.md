# Starting guide

## Unlocking Daisy Mae

Although you do not necessarily need to have Daisy Mae unlocked to start your turnip trading adventure, she is available extremely early in the game becoming available after only a couple days of first playing the game. If you already have Daisy Mae unlocked, you may skip this section.

Before you can start trading turnips you will need to have **Nook's Cranny** unlocked. If you haven't already, here is the list of in game accomplishments you must do before starting the quest to unlock it. 

* Pay off the initial 5,000 Nook Miles debt
* Upgrade from a tent to a house
* Donate 5 unique bugs/fish to Tom Nook and place Blathers' tent

The next day, upon entering Resident Services, Timmy and Tom Nook will be seen discussing opening a store on the island. Speak to Timmy to learn more and be asked to supply crafting materials for the store's construction:

* 30 softwood
* 30 wood
* 30 hardwood
* 30 iron nuggets

After successfully delivering all these materials and picking a location for the store. Nook's Cranny will be open at 8 AM the next day.

Once Nook's Cranny has been unlocked, Daisy Mae will now come to town on Sundays from 5am - 12pm every week.

## A little pocket money

It takes money to earn money, and buying turnips is no exception.  
If you wanted to go deep into the Stalk Market for those big returns our suggestion would be start with enough money to buy a full inventory of Turnips. 

Depending on your inventory size and the price Daisy Mae is selling turning for, the largest amount you would need for a full inventory would be 440,000 bells.

Here's a few ideas how to make some quick bucks
